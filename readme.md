# Google Tab

A chrome extension for Edge browser to create a new tab similar to Google Chrome.

## why?

In my opnion, I really like the experience of Edge browser, but I don't like Bing tabs. So I made an extension to change the default tabs.

## How to use

You can download this compressed package in your computer, and plug it into your Edge.

You may come across some setup options, don't worry, everything is safe.

Hope you like.

## Some Features
